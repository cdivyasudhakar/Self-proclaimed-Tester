## Developing
HTML5, CSS3 and Twitter BootStrap :

• BootStrap supports HTML and CSS based design templates as well as 

Java Script extensions. It helps in building a rich front end for dynamic 

web applications.

• BootStrap supports responsive web design. This feature helps in 

building web applications in a much better way as the layout would be 

adjusted dynamically according to the device on which the web 

application is being used.

Angular JS framework

• Simplifies the development and the testing of applications by 

providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC). 

• The AngularJS library works by reading the HTML page, in which 

custom tag attributes are embedded. Angular interprets those attributes 

as directives to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is 

represented by standard JavaScript variables. 

Nodejs:

•  Ideal for building fast, scalable network applications, as it’s capable of 

handling a huge number of simultaneous connections with high 

throughput, which equates to high scalability. 

• Node.js operates on a single-thread, using non-blocking I/O calls, 

allowing it to support tens of thousands of concurrent connections. 

• Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework 

that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

MySQL:

• MySQL represents data in tables and rows. One of the best things 

about MySQL is the JOIN operation. This allows the flexibility to query 

data across multiple tables. 

• MySQL supports atomic transactions. Since the data we used in our 

application is structured and fits well into tables, we have chosen 

MySQL as it offers robust and easy interaction with our data.
