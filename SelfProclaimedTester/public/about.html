           <h2>Self Proclaimed Tester</h2>
           <p>A few years ago, if a product solved an unmet need or a critical task at hand, users were more than happy to use it. Today, users are looking for more: engaging and delightful experiences every day. A better experience is at the top of the user expectations list. According to research, most customers will think less of an organization if their experience is not great. Even more importantly, studies have also found that customers will never trust the organization again if their experience is not great.

Mobile devices, as we know, are mobile and are not designed to be hung on the wall! Without sensors, location services, camera and communication features, we would just have a really lame mini-computer in our pockets. These reasons outline the need to test real devices, under real world conditions and not within the comforts of an office cubicle.</p>

                  Consider a music streaming app like Spotify that streams music on the go. Testing this app amidst the luxuries of a cubicle with the best possible infrastructure is not enough. In some locations, users may not have access to a specific network, while others may have dead spots where the connection is cut off completely and a few others may have multiple 2G and 3G towers within a small distance, expecting mobile devices and apps to handle network switching between towers on their own.

                  A mobile persona is a fictitious identity that represents one of the user groups who will use the mobile app. Understanding the target user base helps testers come up with ideas to test similarly to how users might use the app.

Testers can think of different contexts and test apps depending on the user group. Using mobile personas, testers may not be able to get into the shoes of the users – simply because the users’ shoe sizes are too different from theirs. However, understanding the personas will help testers be aware of how users might use the app and will help design test ideas pretty close to them.

                  A user scenario is a narrative that describes how a particular user persona uses the app and how the app fits into their day to day lives. Identifying scenarios which are specific to each user in a user group is a good starting point for testing. User scenarios can vary depending on mobile personas. For example, a teenager looking for a medical insurance plan on a mobile app’s actions are very different from a 65 year old retiree who is looking for an optimized plan that will help him take care of medical expenses in his old age with a small income. Thinking of these two users helps testers think of different contexts in which they might use the mobile app differently.

Testing on the field in different network conditions is a great way to unearth app problems that are hard to find, sitting at a cubicle. This is where field testing is of profound value in finding several problems that exist only under real world conditions.
